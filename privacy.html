    <h1>D-deskcal Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 22, 2025</p>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how D-deskcal (the "App") handles your data.</p>

    <h2>1. No-Server Principle</h2>
    <p><strong>D-deskcal does not use any developer-operated servers.</strong> All your information is transmitted and stored only between Google's servers and your personal computer. No data is ever sent to or stored by the developer.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Access and Why</h2>
    <p>The App requests access to the following information via the Google OAuth 2.0 protocol. This is essential for providing the App's core functionality.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Calendar Data (Read, Write, Modify, Delete permissions):</strong> This permission is used solely for the App's core function: to display your calendar on the screen and to allow you to add, edit, and delete events directly from the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Basic User Information (Email Address):</strong> This is used only to identify which account is currently logged into the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Where Your Information Is Stored</h2>
    <p>All data used by the App is stored exclusively in secure locations on your personal computer.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication Token (`token.json`):</strong> The authentication token required to access Google Calendar is stored only on your local computer. This file is never transmitted outside the App.</li>
        <li><strong>App Settings and Cache Data (`settings.json`, `calendar.db`):</strong> Your configured options and calendar cache data for faster loading are also stored only on your local computer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>The App does not share or sell any of your information with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us at the email below.</p>
